W:Albert Mooney says he loves her,
W:All the boys are fighting for her.
W:They knock at the door and they ring at the bell,
W:Saying "Oh my true love are you well?"
W:Out she comes, as white as snow,
W:Ring on her fingers and bells on her toes.
W:Old Johnny Murray says she'll die
W:If she doesn't get the fellow with the roving eye.

W:Let the wind and the rain and the hail blow high,
W:And the snow com tumbling from the sky.

W:She'll get her own lad by and by.
W:When she get a lad of her own,
W:She won't tell her ma when she goes home.
W:Let them all come as they will,
W:For it's Albert Mooney she loves still.
